Description: Qt module for creating state machines from SCXML files development
 The Qt SCXML module provides functionality to create state
 machines from SCXML files. This includes both dynamically
 creating state machines (loading the SCXML file and instantiating
 states and transitions) and generating a C++ file that has a class
 implementing the state machine. It also contains functionality
 to support data models and executable content.
 .
 This package contains the development files for qtscxml.
